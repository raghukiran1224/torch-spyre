class IndirectSource:
    """Describes data-dependent (indirect) addressing for a tensor argument.

    When present on a TensorArg, the tensor's base address along ``gather_dim``
    is computed at runtime by reading values from another tensor argument (the
    index tensor) rather than using a static affine expression.

    This models the ``A[X[i]]`` pattern needed for MoE expert selection, paged
    attention, and similar gather/scatter workloads.

    Attributes:
        index_arg_index: Position of the index tensor in the OpSpec's ``args``
            list.  The index tensor supplies the runtime-computed indices.
        gather_dim: Which dimension of *this* tensor is indirectly addressed.
            For MoE expert selection where experts are stacked along dim 0,
            ``gather_dim=0``.
        base_offset_expr: A sympy expression that maps each index value to a
            byte offset.  The free variable ``index_value`` represents the
            value read from the index tensor at runtime.  For example,
            ``index_value * 32768`` when each expert is 32 KiB.
